Hi! I am **Dong Xing**, a sophomore at **[Princeton International School of Mathematics and Science](https://prismsus.org/)**.

I am interested in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. I have been in the **[USA Computing Olympiad](https://usaco.org/) Platinum Division** since 2025.

This blog is a garden of my thoughts. Hope you have a great time!
